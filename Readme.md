# Arctis Pro Wireless Helper
> A small tool to read information from the SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless headset and automatically switch the audio output device based on that.

## Setup
Start the application with the `list` parameter to list all currently available output devices.
Add the GUIDs of the two output devices you want to use to the `Config.ini` file.

## Usage
After the `Config.ini` has been setup just start the application.

## Compiling
There are no dependencies so the project can be compiled without installing any third party libraries. Just open the Visual Studio project file and press the build button.
